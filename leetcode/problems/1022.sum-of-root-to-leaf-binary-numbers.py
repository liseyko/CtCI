#
# Given a binary tree, each node has value 0 or 1.  Each root-to-leaf path
# represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.  For
# example, if the path is 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1, then this could represent
# 01101 in binary, which is 13.
# 
# For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from
# the root to that leaf.
# 
# Return the sum of these numbers.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
# Output: 22
# Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 1000.
# node.val is 0 or 1.
# The answer will not exceed 2^31 - 1.
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def sumRootToLeaf(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
