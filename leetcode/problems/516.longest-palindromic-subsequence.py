# Testcase Example:  '"bbbab"'
#
# 
# Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You
# may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: 
# 
# "bbbab"
# 
# Output: 
# 
# 4
# 
# One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# Input:
# 
# "cbbd"
# 
# Output:
# 
# 2
# 
# One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
