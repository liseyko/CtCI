#
# In an infinite chess board with coordinates from -infinity to +infinity, you
# have a knight at square [0, 0].
# 
# A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is
# two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal
# direction.
# 
# 
# 
# Return the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square
# [x, y].  It is guaranteed the answer exists.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: x = 2, y = 1
# Output: 1
# Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: x = 5, y = 5
# Output: 4
# Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1] → [4, 2] → [3, 4] → [5, 5]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# |x| + |y| <= 300
# 
#
