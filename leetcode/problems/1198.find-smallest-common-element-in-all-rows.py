#
# Given a matrix mat where every row is sorted in increasing order, return the
# smallest common element in all rows.
# 
# If there is no common element, return -1.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: mat = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,4,5,8,10],[3,5,7,9,11],[1,3,5,7,9]]
# Output: 5
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= mat.length, mat[i].length <= 500
# 1 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^4
# mat[i] is sorted in increasing order.
# 
#

class Solution:
    def smallestCommonElement(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> int:
