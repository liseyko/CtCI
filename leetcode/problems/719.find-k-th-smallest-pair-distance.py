#
# Given an integer array, return the k-th smallest distance among all the
# pairs. The distance of a pair (A, B) is defined as the absolute difference
# between A and B. 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input:
# nums = [1,3,1]
# k = 1
# Output: 0 
# Explanation:
# Here are all the pairs:
# (1,3) -> 2
# (1,1) -> 0
# (3,1) -> 2
# Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 2 .
# 0 .
# 1 .
