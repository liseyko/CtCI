# Testcase Example:  '[[4,10,15,24,26],[0,9,12,20],[5,18,22,30]]'
#
# You have k lists of sorted integers in ascending order. Find the smallest
# range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.
# 
# We define the range [a,b] is smaller than range [c,d] if b-a < d-c or a < c
# if b-a == d-c.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
# Output: [20,24]
# Explanation: 
# List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
# List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
# List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The given list may contain duplicates, so ascending order means >= here.
# 1 <= k <= 3500
# -10^5 <= value of elements <= 10^5.
#

class Solution:
    def smallestRange(self, nums: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
